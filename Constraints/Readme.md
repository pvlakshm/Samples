# Constraint programming
This sample illustrates the implementation of constraints, common in CAD systems. Instsead of using a CAD assembly with constraints, it uses a temperature converter modelled as a circuit with constraints. Provide a value at either end of the circuit, and a result will get computed at the other end. The constraints propogate the computation of the results through the circuit. This is based on the article [Solving Constraits with J#](https://web.archive.org/web/20050409074523/http://msdn.microsoft.com:80/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/bjConstraints.asp) that appeeared in MSDN many years ago.
